    The “Ethiktool“ software supports applicants in writing their ethics proposal. A user-centered dialogue guides applicants through all relevant questions and requests information for the ethics application form, the informed consent form, and other participant documents.
    
    Further information is available in the sections “About us“ and “About the Ethiktool“. Please note the “Technical Information“ and “Terms of Use“ for the Ethiktool.
    You are welcome to read more about the Ethiktool development on our <a data-lang="en" href="https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/physik/SFKS/ethiktool/index.html.en" target="_blank">project website</a>.

    <i>Please note: In the current project phase, the Ethiktool is intended for filing an application at Chemnitz University of Technology or at Bielefeld University. Alternatively, you can test the Ethiktool's functionality by choosing “Test ethics committee“. The Ethiktool is currently being prepared for use at other sites; the Ethics Committees of the Department of Psychology of JGU Mainz and of the German Aerospace Center are already in the beta stage.

    You can start creating an application for the respective committee via the “New proposal“ option.
    You can load and edit an existing XML file created by the Ethiktool via “Load proposal”.</i>

             Any person carrying out independent research at Chemnitz University of Technology is eligible to apply; this explicitly includes doctoral candidates. The responsibility for the ethics application in case of undergraduate theses and other student research projects lies with the teaching staff or supervisors.

             The ethics proposal must be submitted <i>before</i> the start of a research project; retrospective ethics approvals are not possible.
    
             Research projects involving medical, pharmaceutical or other research that may require an assessment in accordance with the German Medicinal Products Act (AMG), Medical Device Law Implementation Act (MPDG) or other legal requirements must be submitted to a medical ethics committee.}
      EUB   {Please note the following <b>requirements for the application:</b>
    
             The use of the Ethiktool is currently reserved for applications in the detailed procedure.
             
             Members and affiliates of Bielefeld University are eligible to apply. Students can also file an application for their final theses and other student research, the teaching staff or supervisor(s) have to check and approve the application before submission.

             The ethics proposal should be submitted <i>before</i> the start of a research project. Only in justified exceptional cases, the Ethics Review Board may carry out a retrospective review. Further information on the procedure for retrospective assessments can be found <a href="https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/uni/einrichtungen-organisation/zentrale-organisation/kommissionen/ethik/faq/index.xml" target="_blank">here</a>.
    
             Research projects involving medical, pharmaceutical or other research that may require an assessment in accordance with the German Medicinal Products Act (AMG), Medical Device Law Implementation Act (MPDG) or other legal requirements must be submitted to a medical ethics committee.
              
             Research projects involving physicians as project contributors usually have to be evaluated by a medical ethics committee. In individual cases a review by the non-medical Bielefeld University Ethics Review Board may be possible. Further information can be found <a href="https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/medizin/forschung/foerderung/ethikkommission/" target="_blank">here</a>.}

However, information on the legal situation can be given if deemed necessary. The project contributors should consider on a case-by-case basis whether such information appears useful for the specific study or participant group. Information can be useful, for example, if research is carried out in special settings (e.g., as part of joint walks, field trips); that is, if paths are themselves part of the research (beyond the outward and return journey). If participants are injured during a study, liability issues play a role and details of these are to be provided in a separate question.'

            The first step is to check whether personal data are processed. If that is the case, further aspects are queried to compose the annex on data processing.
            The explanations are not exhaustive and cannot replace a legal assessment of the individual case. In case of doubt, ask the responsible data protection authorities for consultation. If the Ethiktool cannot reflect the structure of your data processing, please also consult the responsible data protection authorities.
            The assessment as to whether data processing in a study is “anonymous“ oder “person-related“ in based both on the research content (i.e., the research data themselves) and on organisational aspects (e.g., data for contacting participants, for issuing a compensation). Only the combined view of research-content data with organisation-related data can indicate whether <u>personal data</u> are processed. <i class="Label-Info" style="display: inline-flex; white-space: initial; width: fit-content"><span style="color: black">According to Article 4 (1) EU-GDPR, “'personal data' means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person“.
             Thus, this also includes data that allow for identification in the context of a study, such as the age in case of data collection in a closed group (training group, school class, or the like) in which only single persons are of a certain age.</span></i>
            The Ethiktool does not ask about technical and organizational measures (TOMs) because these are usually not part of the data privacy statement. Of course, you are obliged to take appropriate action, such as suitable measures to ensure that the data are protected against unauthorised access. Please consult the responsible data protection authorities; usually you will fill a record of processing activities according to Article 30 EU-GDPR, yet this does not undergo ethics review.

The broadest class of data access (“Zugriffsklasse 0“) refers to completely open data without usage restrictions. More restrictive classes of access refer to data being provided under certain usage conditions, such as re-use for scientific purposes only.

    Our mission is to facilitate the generation and evaluation of ethics proposals. Hence we provide the Ethiktool free of charge to all interested ethics committees. The Ethiktool development is based on our longstanding experience in ethics committee work and our experience with the predecessor software, which was developed under the leadership of Alexandra Bendixen and introduced at TU Chemnitz in 2021. The development of the current version has been financially supported by the Volkswagen Foundation since 2023, with their support set to continue until 2026.

    You are using version {toolVersion} of the browser-based Ethiktool. A list of changes relative to previous versions can be found <a data-lang="en" href="https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/physik/SFKS/ethiktool/updates.html.en" target="_blank">here</a>. 
    
    The Ethiktool simplifies the generation and evaluation of ethics proposals for research involving human participants, in particular for non-medical research. Based on your responses to questions that are automatically adapted to your input, the Ethiktool generates the application documents as well as all participant documents (including information, consent, and data privacy). The Ethiktool is a joint development of a project team headed by Prof. Dr. Alexandra Bendixen (Chemnitz University of Technology, TUC), which comprises members from TUC, the Leibniz Institute for Psychology (ZPID), and Bielefeld University. The development has been based on experience with a predecessor software developed and used at TUC. 
    
    We continuously extend and improve the Ethiktool. We therefore greatly appreciate your support by sending us error reports, questions and remarks via email to <a href="mailto:ethiktool@tu-chemnitz.de">ethiktool@tu-chemnitz.de</a>*. If you experience technical issues with the current version, please contact <a href="mailto:ethiktool@leibniz-psychology.org">ethiktool@leibniz-psychology.org</a>.
    
    Are you a member of an ethics committee, IRB or otherwise involved in evaluating or processing ethics applications? If you are interested in introducing the Ethiktool at your site, you are very welcome to contact us at <a href="mailto:ethiktool@tu-chemnitz.de">ethiktool@tu-chemnitz.de</a>*.

    Your browser must have cookies and JavaScript enabled for the Ethiktool to function properly. Please do not delete cookies during the session. It is not advisable to work with the Ethiktool in more than one open browser tab. Moreover, please do not navigate forward and backward within the browser; instead, use the Ethiktool's “next page“ and “previous page“ buttons.

    To start the application process, begin with “Proposal data“ and click through the form step by step via the “next page“ button. Alternatively, you can also jump directly to specific sections (e.g., project details) in the navigation bar on the left.

    On the right-hand side, you will see a preview of the application document and the participant documents. You can click on the questions or headings to jump directly to the related sections in the Ethiktool. In the area above the preview, you are informed about missing or incorrect input.

    Please save your entries regularly. The files are stored locally on your computer in XML format. You can pause the process at any time, reload your saved entries as an XML file later and continue editing them.

    Once you have made all entries, please use “Check entries“ to ensure that everything is complete and consistent. If necessary, please correct your entries.

    If the technical check reveals no errors, you are ready to generate the documents for submission by selecting “complete proposal“. During the process, you may need to add your own PDF documents, depending on the information you entered.

    Ultimately, you will receive an integrated document as a PDF file, along with the underlying XML file. Both files {committeeType, select,
      testCommittee {will later (after the testing phase) form the basis for submitting the ethics application; the XML file will also be needed for any revisions to the application. Moreover, you will receive individual documents for the various parts of the application. Please note that you are participating in a test run and that you should not actually use the documents at this point.}

                                                other       {{committeeAcc}}}. You will also receive individual documents for each part of the application for your own use. Please note that you will need the XML file for any revisions to your application.}}
